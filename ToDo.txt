- Info Part
	=> Need to be able to return to calling template

- View Stack
	=> onCreated => push view
	=> onDestroyed => popView??? Doesn't work since onDestroyed is called when we go on to next view
	=> popView
	=> revisit IronRouter???
	
	class ViewState
		- { view, navBar, rightBar }
		- pushState
		- popState
		- goToState
		- clearState
		- length
		- NO forward


- parts only has part, no myParts
- parts rightBar Favorite Parts -> My Parts => select_parts
	- authentication outside of select_parts => enclosing template: my_parts to handle authentication
		=> can this be generic?  authentication then dynamic template?
	=> No, authentication inside so that if user logs out from navbar, we do the right thing.
		=> Opportunity for a wrapper?
