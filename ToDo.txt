- Info Part
	=> Need to be able to return to calling template

- View Stack
	=> onCreated => push view
	=> onDestroyed => popView??? Doesn't work since onDestroyed is called when we go on to next view
	=> popView
	=> revisit IronRouter???
	
	class ViewState - Decide how to deal with rightBar/navBar changes, how to switch renderView
		- { view, navBar, rightBar }
		- pushState
		- popState
		- goToState
		- clearState
		- length
		- NO forward

- Parts
	=> Add Info Part to right bar
		Figure out generic Info Part selection mechanism that will work across both single and shared part selections
			=> SelectionManager
		
- Part Selection
	=> unify click part selection and slick part selection into single message on the select bus
	
- Info Lawn

- parts only has part, no myParts
- parts rightBar Favorite Parts -> My Parts => select_parts
	- authentication outside of select_parts => enclosing template: my_parts to handle authentication
		=> can this be generic?  authentication then dynamic template?
	=> No, authentication inside so that if user logs out from navbar, we do the right thing.
		=> Opportunity for a wrapper?
