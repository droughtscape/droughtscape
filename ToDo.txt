- View Stack
	=> onCreated => push view
	=> onDestroyed => popView??? Doesn't work since onDestroyed is called when we go on to next view
	=> popView
	=> revisit IronRouter???
	
	class ViewState - Decide how to deal with rightBar/navBar changes, how to switch renderView
		- { view, navBar, rightBar }
		- pushState
		- popState
		- goToState
		- clearState
		- length
		- NO forward
		
		=> Analysis:
			The Droughtscape UI has 3 areas:
				navBar
					=> contents controlled by Session(navBarConfig)
				render
					=> contents controlled by Session(renderView)
				rightBar
					=> presence or absence controlled by Session(rightBar)
					=> contents controlled by Session(rightBarConfig)
					
					
					!! if we always keep rightBar, then only need rightBarConfig
				navBar and rightBar are populated by the onCreated template callback.
				renderView sets the template
				
			We could either:
				=> set the bars outside the template
					- The good thing here is that the micro templates are less coupled to navBar, rightBar which
						really are global to the renderView.
				=> pass the dynamic data in as a context to the template and genericize the onCreated, onDestroyed callbacks
				=> We will use MBus for communicating between bars and template
					

- Info Part
	=> Need to be able to return to calling template
	=> Need large slide[0..N] images

- Lawns
	NavBar
	=> All Lawns
	RightBar
		=> New Lawn
		=> My Lawns
		=> Info Lawn
	=> My Lawns
		=> New Lawn
		=> Lawns
		=> Info Lawn
		
- Parts
	=> Add Info Part to right bar
		Figure out generic Info Part selection mechanism that will work across both single and shared part selections
			=> SelectionManager
		
- Part Selection
	=> unify click part selection and slick part selection into single message on the select bus
	
- Info Lawn

- parts only has part, no myParts
- parts rightBar Favorite Parts -> My Parts => select_parts
	- authentication outside of select_parts => enclosing template: my_parts to handle authentication
		=> can this be generic?  authentication then dynamic template?
	=> No, authentication inside so that if user logs out from navbar, we do the right thing.
		=> Opportunity for a wrapper?
		
- Bugs
	SlickJS => Sometimes the onBefore callback has currentSlide, nextSlide the same.
		This makes sense at the boundaries but not in the middle of the carousel or if we are moving off
		the boundaries.  This causes selection highlighting to get messed up since both slides and clicks
		change the border highlight.
		=> Temp fix
